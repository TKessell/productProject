# Product Project
## OOP product line project

This is my first project of OOP (COP 3003), a simple JavaFX window that shows a product log, product line, and products.
I worked on this independently, but with help from teaching assistants in my class through office hours.
I began working on this project during the first week of my Fall 2020 Semester. Before starting, I had a decent background in Java programming, as I took the AP course in high school.
I made this project for a semester-long assignment, where each week a new challenge was overcome and the program was refined to incorporate various elements of object oriented programming, like classes, interfaces, enums, and security measures.
